## Context

In December 2025, Flow underwent a comprehensive architecture refactoring:
- Reorganized 44 components into 8 logical folders
- Fixed all import paths and cross-component dependencies
- Enhanced AppContext with missing handlers
- Improved build process and deployment

These docs track that work and serve as reference for future improvements.
